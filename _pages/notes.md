## Organisation
- Together with Daniel Echtler, I organized the GRK workshop WS23/24 "Characteristic classes" [program](/assets/pdf/grk_workshop_charclasses.pdf).

## Miscellaneous
- On 12.03.2022 the HHU organised a public event for the "International Day of Mathematics"  where PhD students presented their research topics ([news](https://www.hhu.de/news-einzelansicht/so-innovativ-und-spannend-kann-mathematik-sein) (in german)). <br/> I presented a [poster](/assets/pdf/Poster_TagDerMathematik.pdf) there too (this is a typographically improved version, also in german).
