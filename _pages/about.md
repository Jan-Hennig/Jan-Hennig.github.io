I am a PhD student in the research training group [GRK 2240: Algebro-Geometric Methods in Algebra, Arithmetic and Topology](https://reh.math.uni-duesseldorf.de/~grk2240/index.html). My supervisors are [Marcus Zibrowius](https://www.math.uni-duesseldorf.de/~zibrowius/index_DE.html) (HHU) and [Matthias Wendt](https://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~wendt/) (BUW).

My research interests revolve around algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and their interactions. More specifically, this includes algebraic K-theory and motivic homotopy theory. The current project I am working on is about Chow-Witt rings and (quadratically) refined enumerative geometry.
