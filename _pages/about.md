I am a PhD student in the research training group [GRK 2240: Algebro-Geometric Methods in Algebra, Arithmetic and Topology](https://reh.math.uni-duesseldorf.de/~grk2240/index.html). My supervisors are Marcus Zibrowius (HHU) and Matthias Wendt (BUW).

My research interests revolve around algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and their interactions. More specifically this includes algebraic K-theory and motivic homotopy theory. The current project I am working on is about Chow-Witt rings and (quadratically) refined enumerative geometry.

[//]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
